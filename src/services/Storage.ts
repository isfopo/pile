 * A class that provides a wrapper around the VSCode Memento storage.

 * The Storage class facilitates the retrieval and storage of data in a
 * persistent manner using the Memento API. It supports generic types for
 * storing and retrieving different data types, and includes methods to
 * manage date entities specifically.
 *
 * @class Storage
 * @constructor
 * @param {Memento} storage - An instance of Memento for managing persistent storage.
 *
 * @method get<T>(key: string): T
 * Retrieves a value associated with the specified key from storage.
 * Returns null if the key does not exist.
 *
 * @method set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>
 * Stores a value associated with the specified key in the storage.
 * This is an asynchronous operation.
 *
 * @method getDates(): Day[]
 * Retrieves an array of Day objects from the storage for keys that
 * correspond to valid day entries. Filters out any invalid or undefined entries.
 *
 * @method reset(): void
 * Resets the storage by updating all keys to 'undefined', effectively
 * clearing the stored data.
