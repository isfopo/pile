/**
 * The Day class represents a specific date and manages tasks associated with that date.

 * Each instance of the Day class consists of a date (as a string) and an array of task IDs
 * associated with that date. This class provides methods to stringify the instance, parse
 * from JSON or another Day instance, and static methods to obtain formatted dates, validate
 * date strings, and manipulate the task list for specific days.
 *
 * Key functionalities of the Day class include:
 * - Serializing and deserializing instances to and from JSON.
 * - Retrieving todayâ€™s date and calculating past dates.
 * - Formatting dates into user-friendly strings.
 * - Validating date formats to ensure correctness.
 * - Adding tasks to the current day instance and generating unique IDs for those tasks.
 * - Converting the Day instance into a DayTreeItem for easy management in a tree structure.
